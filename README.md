# 3D-Perturbed-Rod
### 3D-Model for Mechanical Test on Randomly Perturbed Cylinder

**C++**â€“code developed for three-dimensional P1 finite element approximation. The approximation is used for evaluating an effective Young's modulus for a three-dimensional cylinder geometry with different radii which is perturbed by correlated shifts of layers along the longitudinal axis. 

For more details on the usage of the code please check the **"README.txt"** file.

The development of the software in **C++** was done by **<a href = https://aam.uni-freiburg.de/mitarb/wolffvorbeck/index.html>Steve Wolff-Vorbeck<a/>** (**University of Freiburg**) on the basis of a finite element software package created by **Prof. Patrick Dondl** (**University of Freiburg**).

For more details on the usage of the code please check the **"README.txt"** file.

The Code includes the cubic spline interpolation **"spline.h"** which is used from <a href ="https://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/">Tino Kluge</a> under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2.


The Code was developed for siumlation and numerical analysis within a joint research work that will be on arxiv soon.
